//! estimate). This module imports nothing from the rest of the crate — it is a
//! dependency leaf — so a feature can name the shapes it persists or reports
//! without reaching up (or sideways) into the modules that produce them. Those
//! producers import these shapes back down from here, so there is no cycle.
//!
//! These are the canonical definitions; their `ts-rs` bindings (`StepStatus.ts`,
//! `StructureLockCheck.ts`, `StructureLockResult.ts`, `TokenTotals.ts`) are
//! generated unchanged from here — relocating a type does not alter its
//! generated TS (that depends on the name/fields/derives/`export_to`, not the
//! Rust module path).
