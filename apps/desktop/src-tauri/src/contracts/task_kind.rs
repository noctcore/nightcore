//! The hand-written `TaskKind` — the Rust→ts-rs source for the web's
//! `TaskKind.ts`, and the type stored on `Task.kind`.
//!
//! Homed in `contracts` (rank 1) because `TaskKind` is a wire/contract enum, not
//! a store concern (issue #17 phase A.3b — it previously lived in `store::task`,
//! which made the `contracts` parity guard reach UP into `store`). It is the
//! THIRD authoring of the kind vocabulary — the zod `TaskKindSchema` and the
//! zod→Rust [`generated::TaskKind`](super::generated) are the other two; the
//! parity guard in [`super`] asserts this copy and the generated one carry the
//! same variant/wire set, so adding a kind must touch every site.
//!
//! Deliberately NOT re-exported at the `contracts` module root: the glob
//! `pub use generated::*` already binds `contracts::TaskKind` to the wire enum
//! (`provider` imports it as `WireTaskKind`), so this copy is reached via its
//! submodule path and back-compat re-exported at `crate::task::TaskKind`.
