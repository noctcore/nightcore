/**
 * Nightcore Claude provider sidecar.
 *
 * There is no Rust Claude Agent SDK, so the agent loop runs here — in Bun — and
 * the Rust/Tauri core drives it as a child process over a line-delimited (NDJSON)
 * stdio protocol:
 *
 *   stdin   ← one JSON `SurfaceCommand` per line  (start-session, send-input,
 *             approve-permission, interrupt, set-model, set-permission-mode)
 *   stdout  → one JSON `NightcoreEvent` per line   (session lifecycle, assistant
 *             deltas, tool use, permission requests, completion)
 *   stderr  → human-readable logs only (never part of the protocol)
 *
 * This is deliberately thin: it forwards parsed commands straight into the
 * existing `SessionManager` and streams every emitted event back out. All the
 * orchestration intelligence (the auto-loop, concurrency, worktrees, dependency
 * ordering) lives in the Rust core, NOT here. Swapping in a different provider
 * later means writing another sidecar that speaks this same protocol.
 *
 * The protocol plumbing (event sink, command framing, manager wiring) is factored
 * into small, injectable units so it can be unit-tested with a stub manager — no
 * live Claude session, no token use, no cost. The live entrypoint at the bottom
 * (`import.meta.main`) wires the real `SessionManager` to real stdio.

 * field per delta, which materially outweighs the `JSON.stringify` that follows

 * once per completed tool call across every concurrent session and is the single
 * most expensive event to validate: its `content` field carries the full

 * of KB), which the union walk re-validates variant by variant to reach the

/**
 * Wire a manager to an event sink and return a command handler.
 *
 * - Every event the manager emits is encoded and pushed to `sink` (one line).
 * - Permission requests are RELAYED, not auto-denied: a `permission-required`
 *   event reaches the wire like any other and the session parks in the engine
 *   awaiting a surface decision. The Rust core surfaces the prompt to the UI and
 *   sends back an `approve-permission` command (interactively, or a fail-closed
 *   deny on cancel/abort) — long waits are fine, the engine settles the parked
 *   request when the decision arrives. The sidecar stays dumb; it answers nothing
 *   on its own.
 * - The returned `handleLine` parses one NDJSON command, validates it against
 *   `SurfaceCommandSchema`, and dispatches it. It logs (never throws) on either
 *   malformed JSON OR a command that fails schema validation, so one bad line
 *   can't kill the stream. A rejected `dispatch` is caught and logged for the
 *   same reason — the manager degrades-not-throws, but a defensive `.catch`
 *   keeps an unexpected rejection from becoming an unhandled rejection that
